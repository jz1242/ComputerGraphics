Human vision
	Vision - light bounces and triggers response in eye, diff wavelengths
	Visible light - freq: 400nm - 700nm
	retina has cones and rods: 6-7 mill cones in retina
	cones:
		responsible for photopic vision
		Color sensitive
	Rods: 120 mill roda retina
		1000x more light sensitive
		monochromatic vision
	Tristimulus Theory of Color
		Spectral response functions of each of the 3 types of cones on human retina
		RGB
	Does not mean we can see the difference between the different spectral distribution
	metameters - 2 spectral distributions that look the same
	
Image Representation
	pixel -something that cpatures the notion of color
	luminance pixels
		grey scale images(intensity images)
		0-1.0 or 0 - 255
	RGB pixels
	color pixels0-1.0 or 0-255 (8bit)(HDR11bit more color channels)
Resolution
	spatial resolution: width x heigt pixel
	intensity color resolution: n bits per pixel
	temporal resolution: n Hz(fps)
Image Quantitization Artifacts
	with only a small number of bits for each color channel there is limit to intensity resolution of an images
		black which images allocates 1 bits
		
		alpha = 0 calculate grey scale image
